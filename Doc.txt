Documentation - 

All features : 
	- Only one worker per cell
	- each resource or building cell has an inventory
	- clicking on a slot -> shows the possible actions (harvest / collect / turn to city)
	- clicking on a slot containing a player -> shows the possible actions (drop / move)
	- player inventory inside City 
	- worker harvesting -> constant value
	- cell's stock limited (the more it has resrouces left, the more it regains fast)
	- worker's inventory divided in 3 part -> harvesting = fulfilling a third of its inventory.

Must implement : 
	##### PATHFINDING FUCNTION #####
	Cells ; 
		CityHall building (Building.java) at start -> has the overall inventory
		OnClick -> show all the possible actions (on the panel) 
			    - Resources Cell : Harvest / Build
			    - Worker Cell : Drop / Move
			    - Adjacent to city Cell : Expand 
			    - CityHall Cell : New Worker
			    - Building Cell : Collect
			    
			-> show the cell's information (on the panel too)
			    - CellId 
			    - Resource Quantity
			    - Production rate
			    - if worker on it -> shows worker's infos 
			    			   - inventory
			    - if CityHall -> shows Occupied & Free Workers lists
			    
		Continuous Behaviour ;
		
	Worker ;
		2 worker at start (1 per city slot) 
		2 lists -> one Occupied, one Free
		When inventory is full -> automatically sets occupied & goes drop
	Panel ; 
		Possibles actions ; (takes place in CellCtrl) + (take a constant time) + (when a worker doing something -> not free)
			- Harvest -> the nearest free worker goes to the clicked cell to harvest (takes a constant amount of the resources)
			- Build -> the nearest free worker goes to the clicked cell to turn it into a building (corresponding to the initial 
				   Cell's type) !! necessitates the needed resources !!
			- Drop -> the clicked worker goes to the cityhall and drop all his inventory into the city's one
			- Move -> the clicked worker goes to the indicated cell 
			- Collect -> the nearest free worker goes to the cell to collect (takes the maximum amount of resources)
			- New Worker -> creates a new worker inside the city !! necessitates the needed resources !!
			- Expand -> turns the clicked cell into a City Cell !! necessitates the needed resources !!

Report Work :  
    - Write Global Analysis (overall project description)
    - tasks List (all we must do throughout the project)
    - tasks repartition (person & time) -> Gant Diagram
    - Global Conception (explains globally what features we want)
    - Detailled Conception (what are the features and how we wanna implement it
